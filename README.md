verview
The **Obstacle Avoidance & Auto Parking System** is an embedded systems project designed to autonomously detect and avoid obstacles while also providing automatic parking capabilities.  
The system is powered by an **ESP32 microcontroller** and utilizes ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement, motor drivers for motion control, and additional electronic components to enhance safety and functionality.

This project was developed as part of an **Embedded Systems** course to demonstrate practical applications of sensor integration, motor control, and real-time decision-making in robotics.

## System Architecture
1. **Sensor Layer** ‚Äî Ultrasonic sensors measure distances in multiple directions.  
2. **Control Layer** ‚Äî ESP32 processes data and decides actions based on obstacle detection and parking requirements.  
3. **Actuation Layer** ‚Äî L293D motor driver controls the motors to adjust movement and steering.  
4. **Feedback Layer** ‚Äî Buzzer and LED indicators provide status updates to the user.

## How It Works
1. **Power On** ‚Äî System initializes sensors and motors.  
2. **Obstacle Detection** ‚Äî Ultrasonic sensors continuously monitor distances.  
3. **Decision Making** ‚Äî Microcontroller decides to move forward, stop, turn, or park.  
4. **Parking Mode** ‚Äî Engages when the system detects a parking slot within range.  
5. **Alerts** ‚Äî Buzzer and LEDs signal proximity warnings.
